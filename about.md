This is an experiment to look into how we might make our <a href="{{ site.original_crosswords_site_url }}">long-suffering crosswords</a> less paper-y.

There are some rough edges but, hopefully, there is enough here of interest to encourage you to spend some time, have a play, and then send us some feedback!

N.B. we are particularly keen to hear how these crosswords behave on smartphones.

<h3>Announcement</h3>
<p>2019/01/09: After a year and more of manually (and irregularly) echoing the static crosswords
from <a href="https://www.ft.com/crossword">www.ft.com/crossword</a> as interactive crosswords in this site,
there will be a pause while we sort out a more permanent solution.
