This is an experiment to look into how we might make our <a href="{{ site.original_crosswords_site_url }}">long-suffering crosswords</a> less paper-y.

There are lots of rough edges, broken bits, and "oh dear, we forgot"s, but hopefully there is enough here of interest to encourage you to spend some time, have a play, and then send us some feedback!

N.B. we are particularly keen to hear how these crosswords behave on smartphones.

## Known Problems (which we will be working on)

* any answers entered are instantly forgotten after even a page refresh
* the keyboard on Android smartphones is broken
* and many, many more
